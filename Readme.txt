The Esterel assignment code folder contains four different Esterel modules and a top level file, to run a module follow the following steps:

1) Open terminal
2) Navigate to the directory
3) type "make toplevel.xes" 
4) type "./toplevel.xes"

If the program has successfully built and run, a simulation main panel would pop up. This panel could be used to test the code by applying different inputs to see the outputs
and behavior of the code.



There are five modules in the folder
1) fsm.strl, 2) cardrivingcontrol.strl, 3) cruisespeedmanagement.strl, 4) pedaldetection.strl, 5) toplevel.strl
